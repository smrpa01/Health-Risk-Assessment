# Health-Risk-Assessment
Here we have collected datasets from NFHS the government site of India.(http://rchiips.org/nfhs/)
Then we have done the exploratory analysis of the datasets to find some correlation and graph for certain factors for a couple of years.
From which we have tried to visualise the dataset through graph by using R programming language in the IDE of RStudio.
